They get major points for customization - you can pick your spice level, ice level, milk type (including all the usual suspects - oat, almond, soy, etc.), sweetness, and even add a shot of espresso if you're feeling adventurous. My iced chai was perfectly spiced and refreshing, just what I needed on a warm afternoon.\n\nBe aware, though, that this place gets popular! I went on a Sunday around 4 p.m., and it was pretty buzzing. Despite the crowd, the service was friendly and fast. There's indoor seating with a nice vibe and even some outdoor seating if you prefer to soak up the sun (and people watch!).  Another bonus - they're dog-friendly, which is a plus.\n\nOverall, Voyager Craft Coffee is a great spot for a customized coffee drink and a relaxed atmosphere. Just be prepared for a potential wait if you go during peak hours.",

I really couldn’t drink mine (it was Santiago recipe they have at the top of the menu), so I went to order a regular drip coffee, instead of charging me for a new cup, the manager just made it for me at no cost (well replacing the one I didn’t like). I really appreciate such a good service. They were also pretty quick at preparing food (not only for us, but for all customers; we sat at a table near the counter, so we witnessed their service up close).\nThe food was okay, nothing special. The portions are small, but the prices are low, so it works well if you want to grab a quick bite. I do like the fact that you don’t have to order an actual meal. Although it would be nice if they offered a couple of options for those who would like something more substantial like an eggs Benny or lox bagel. The atmosphere was great. It’s a bustling coffee shop with a polite crowd. There is plenty of seating inside and outside. So I’d recommend to check this place out.",
